        <p>"Light and Shadow" was an assignment I did for my <strong>Photo Image Making I</strong> class during my time at CSU.
        As suggested by the title, the series was meant to be an exploration on how light and show can tell a story within the world of photography.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>The photos were shot on my person camera, which is a Minolta X-700. Being a 35mm SLR, I had to develop the film myself and create my own prints.
            The development process combined with the time spent in the darkroom, each print took about 3 hours to make.</p>

        <p>"Fort Collins on Film" is my exploration on capturing exactly what I see walking around Fort Collins. This was my first attempt at shooting on film,
            and my first time developing the negatives and creating prints.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Due to this being my first time exploring film photography as a medium, I found creating the prints to be a difficult and time-consuming process.
            However, after spending a few hours on my first print, it gave me a sense of catharsis and a new-found appreciation for the medium beyond aesthetics.

        <p>"Welcome Home" is an ambitious, darkroom collage comprised of six photos taken around Steamboat Springs. I truly belong is this little mountain town, and I'm
            always in awe of the landscapes here. I'm trying to capture the sublime, just as landscape artists did earlier in American history. As
            a dedicated environmentalist, I want my love of the natural world to encourage people to respect and care for our planet. <strong>This is the only photo here.</strong>
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>With the collage being comprised of six separate photographs, I needed to create six "perfectly exposed" prints before creating the collage.
            On its own, this took about an hour-per-print. Then I had to create cutouts for each element in the collage, and create one
            single print out of it. The entire process for the final product too around 30 hours.

        <p>"A Time of Quiet Between Storms" was taken not too long after receiving my first DSLR, a FujiFilm X-T5. On my way through Poudre Canyon,
            I got caught in a nasty, blistering blizzard. It forced me to stop on the side of the road and let the storm blow over. As soon as the storm calmed down, I looked over
            at the mountains and witnessed the most gorgeous sight I've ever seen in Colorado. <strong>This is the only photo here.</strong>
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>My process for this digital photography is much less intensive in comparison my work with 35mm film. Once I took the photograph, I transferred it onto my computer
            and did some slight exposure and color correction.

        <p>"Lost in Time" was inspired by the rich history of Fort Collins. A lot of the architecture in Old town
            was built somewhere inbetween the 19th and the 20th century, creating a charming and nostalgic atmosphere; this is meant to envoke a sense
            a longing for a time long forgotten. It's beautiful and bittersweet all at the same time.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I had a very small window of time in order to capture these photos. I planned to take all of these during "golden hour" due to the softer shadows
            and warmer colors. It brings a sense of life to the image, playing on that theme of nostalgia.
