      </div>
      <div class="video-description">
        <p>“SUMMER IN THE MOUNTAINS” is the animated GIF I created for the opening page of this website. It acts as a showcase of every skill I've learned over the course of my studies at CSU, and a direct reflection of myself.</p>
        <p>This past year has been a journey of emotional healing, and part of this process was reconnecting with the natural landscapes in Colorado. I feel a spiritual connection to it, and I find myself hiking all the time. My heart is beyond the peaks of the mountains, and my soul is within the trees.</p>
        <p>This piece was modeled and animated entirely in Blender. I created a complex, 2D-image facial rig in order to give my character more emotion in the face, which was a previous limitation my style in 2024. The video was composited in After Effects, adding 2D-animated wind, dust, and birds to add atmosphere. </p>
        <p>All of the sounds were recorded by me on a hiking trip, and the music is a royalty-free beat from BaadBeats titled "PASADENA," which I sampled and slowed down to make it calmer.</p>

          <p class="video-title">“Detective Noir Animated Study” (March 22nd, 2025), Blender Animation<br>28 seconds</p>
        </div>
        <div class="video-description">
          <p>This piece was an animated study I created to experiment more with environment design. Inspired by classic detective noir films, notably "The Third Man," and "Batman: The Animated Series," my goal was to create a grimey and eerie world with a sense of intrigue.</p>
          <p>What I took most into consideration was how light and shadow was used in these works in order to create these crime-filled worlds. Most works within this genre have high-contrast lighting and stark, angular shadows. These shadows aren’t just decorative; they serve as metaphors, hinting at the hidden depths and secrets that lie beneath the surface of the narrative. The play of light and shadow becomes a language of its own, communicating emotions and subtext without words. </p>
          <p>This piece was modeled and animated entirely in Blender, and I composited everything in After Effects. This is where I created animated rain, smoke, and reflections, adding to the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>All of the sounds were recorded by me in Fort Collins, and cleaned up in Audacity.</p>

        <div class="video-description">
          <p>“Blue” is a self-reflective short film about my experience with romance. This boy fell in love several years ago, and became lonely in her absence. He was holding on to that love her for her, preventing him from moving on. In order to let go, he confronts his feelings in the place they used to meet up.</p>
          <p><strong>On April 9th, 2025, “Blue” won “Best Animated Feature” at CSU’s “Through the Student Lens Film Festival.”</strong></p>
          <p>This piece was animated entirely in Blender, with compositing in After Effects and video editing in Premiere Pro. The sound design was done by me. I went outside and recorded sounds out on multiple hikes with my phone, and cleaned it all up in Audacity. Due to the low-poly models, this took about a month to create.</p>
          <p>The music is titled “First Love, Last Kiss,” which is a piece by HUKU from Slip Stream Creative Music Library.
